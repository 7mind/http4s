## Getting Help

<div class="row">

  <div class="col-md-4">
  <h3><i class="fa fa-slack irc"></i> IRC</h3>

  The http4s team and many of its users are available to chat at <a
  href="irc://irc.freenode.net/http4s/">#http4s on Freenode.</a>  The
  channel is not logged<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="ref-1">1</a></sup>.  
  Come join the discussion, ask for help, or just lurk!  
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
  <h3><i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> Mailing list</h3>
  We've started a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/http4s).  
  This lacks the real time give-and-take of IRC, but you won't netsplit 
  before you get a reply.  IRC has been our more popular support channel, 
  but we're here to help.  Don't be shy!
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4"> <h3><i class="fa fa-bug"></i> GitHub
  Issues</h3> http4s uses <a
  href="http://github.com/http4s/issues/issues">GitHub issues</a>.  If
  you think you've hit a bug or have an idea of what we should do next,
  please don't hesitate to <a
  href="http://github.com/http4s/issues/issues/new">submit an issue</a>.
  Your bug reports and request make the project better for everyone.

## Contributing

http4s is an open source project, and depends on its users to continue
to improve.  Here's how you can help:

* [Submit an issue](http://github.com/http4s/http4s/issues/new).  Bug
  reports, feature requests, whatever.  No nit too small to pick.</li>
* Send us a pull request with your original work, compatible with the
  [project's Apache 2
  Licence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/http4s/http4s/master/LICENSE).
  Before a major change, please file an issue or contact us first, so
  we're not duplicating effort.
* If you found the project helpful, pay it forward with a contribution
  to the docs. This site is a simple [Jekyll
  project](http://github.com/http4s/http4s/tree/master/src/jekyll) in
  our main repo.
* We're [@http4s on Twitter](http://twitter.com/http4s).  Tell your
  friends.
